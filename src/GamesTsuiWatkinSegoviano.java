//    Create a driver file, GamesLastName1LastName2LastName3.java,

// A local game store needs a program to do the following:
//
//     Ask the user what type of game they want to play.
//        In a table format, display the options for the type selected, the cost of each option, how many players can play, the average time to play, and the average rating.
//        Ask the user to select which game they want to play.
//        Display ALL information about the selected game using an overridden toString method.
//        Ask the user to verify that this is the game they want to purchase.
//        Ask the user how many copies they want to purchase.
//        Display the total cost.
